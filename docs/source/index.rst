immuneREF: Reference-based similarity comparison of immune repertoires
======================================================================

immuneREF allows the analysis of repertoire similarity on a one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many scale across repertoire 
features ranging from fully sequence- to fully frequency-dependent ones. 

.. figure:: /images/immuneREF_Figures-01.png 

   The immuneREF workflow combines the analysis of a range of features to calculate a multidimensional similarity network of immune repertoires. This enables the identifciation
   of both, global repertoire similarity (many-to-many, one-to-many) and similarity to a reference repertoires (many-to-one, one-to-one)
